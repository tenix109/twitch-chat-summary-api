# Twitch Chat Summary API

Twitch Chat Summary API is a self-hosted Flask API for streamers to automatically collect, summarize, and save Twitch chat messages during streams.

It includes a built-in Pomodoro timer system to support focused work sessions and structured breaks, automatically summarizing chat at the end of each work session.

---

## Features

- Collects live Twitch chat messages during Pomodoro work sessions
- Summarizes chat using a local Ollama model (Mistral, OpenChat, Zephyr, etc.)
- Speaks the generated summary aloud using Edge TTS
- Saves chat logs, text summaries, and spoken audio files
- Supports customizable work and break session lengths
- Designed to be controlled remotely from a separate streaming PC
- Separates all user configuration into a settings file

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running locally
- Microsoft Edge TTS (`edge-tts` Python package)
- Twitch account with OAuth token for chat access

## Pomodoro Workflow

1. Start a work session:
   GET /start_pomodoro?mode=work

   If no `minutes` parameter is provided, the default from `settings.py` will be used.

2. Chat is collected silently during the work session.

3. When the timer completes:
   - The system automatically summarizes, speaks, saves the session, and clears the chat log.
folder
4. Start a break session:
   GET /start_pomodoro?mode=break

   Break sessions do not clear chat or trigger summarization.

---

## Saved Session Logs

When a session is finalized, a folder is created under `session-logs/` containing:

- chat_log.txt – Raw collected chat messages
- summary.txt – Generated text summary
- summary.mp3 – TTS spoken version of the summary

Example folder structure:

```
session-logs/
 └── 2025-04-27_00-44/
      ├── chat_log.txt
      ├── summary.txt
      └── summary.mp3
```

---

## Notes

- Ollama must be running locally before using summarization endpoints.
- Microsoft Edge TTS requires an active internet connection.
- `settings.py` is intentionally ignored by Git for security.
- Only work sessions clear chat and trigger summarization. Break sessions do not.
